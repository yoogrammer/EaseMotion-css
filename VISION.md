# EaseMotion CSS Vision

EaseMotion CSS aims to become a human-readable design language for the web.

---

## The Problem

Modern CSS frameworks push developers in one of two directions:

- **Vanilla CSS** — full power, but everything written from scratch. Slow, inconsistent across projects.
- **Utility frameworks** (Tailwind, etc.) — fast, but class names are abbreviated, cryptic, and require memorization. A new developer cannot read `pt-4 flex items-center gap-x-2` and understand the layout.

Neither approach makes CSS feel natural. Both create cognitive overhead at different points.

---

## The Idea

> Instead of writing complex CSS or memorizing utility classes, developers should be able to describe UI in simple, expressive terms.

EaseMotion CSS is built around a single belief: **if you can say it in English, you should be able to write it as a class.**

```html
<!-- You want to center something — just say it -->
<div class="ease-center">

<!-- You want it to fade in — say it -->
<div class="ease-fade-in">

<!-- You want it to grow on hover — say it -->
<button class="ease-hover-grow">
```

No documentation lookup needed. The class name is the documentation.

---

## The System

EaseMotion CSS is not an open-edit utility library. It is a **curated design system** built through a structured pipeline:

```
Community Ideas
      ↓
 Raw submissions (submissions/examples/)
      ↓
 Maintainer review & standardization
      ↓
 Integrated into core (ease-* naming, CSS variables, comments)
      ↓
 Released as part of the framework
```

Every class that enters EaseMotion CSS has been:
- Reviewed for fit with the philosophy
- Renamed to follow `ease-kebab-case` convention
- Optimized to use CSS custom properties
- Documented before release

This is what separates EaseMotion CSS from a collection of snippets. The curation is the product.

## Long-Term Goals

| Goal | Status |
|------|--------|
| Human-readable core utilities | ✅ v1.0 |
| Animation-first motion library | ✅ v1.0 |
| Curated contribution pipeline | ✅ v1.0 |
| Component library (buttons, cards) | ✅ v1.0 |
| Form components | 🔜 Planned |
| Dark mode tokens | 🔜 Planned |
| CDN distribution | 🔜 Planned |
| npm package | 🔜 Planned |

---

## Design Principles (Non-negotiable)

These principles will never be violated, regardless of contributor demand:

1. **Readability over brevity** — `ease-hover-grow` always over `ease-hg`
2. **CSS variables over hard-coded values** — every color, spacing, and timing value must reference a token
3. **One class, one behavior** — no "super classes" that do five things at once
4. **Accessibility by default** — `prefers-reduced-motion` respected everywhere
5. **Zero dependencies** — EaseMotion CSS ships as plain CSS files, nothing else

**Saptarshi Sadhu**

EaseMotion CSS is a personal project built with long-term intent. The curated model exists not to gatekeep, but to ensure that every release reflects a cohesive, deliberate design language — not a crowdsourced collection of random styles.

# 🌌 Long-Term Vision

EaseMotion CSS aims to become a fully human-readable CSS framework focused on animation, clarity, and zero-config development.

Long-term goals include:

- A complete animation-first design ecosystem
- Extensive utility and component libraries
- Framework integrations for React, Vue, and Astro
- Advanced theming support
- Scroll-triggered and interaction-aware animations
- Educational resources for beginner developers
- Community-curated animation collections

The project will continue prioritizing simplicity, readability, and accessibility over excessive abstraction.

---

# 🚫 What EaseMotion CSS Will NOT Become

To maintain clarity and consistency, EaseMotion CSS intentionally avoids certain directions.

The framework will NOT:

- Become a utility overload framework
- Require mandatory build tooling
- Use unreadable shorthand class names
- Depend on JavaScript for core styling
- Sacrifice readability for micro-optimization
- Introduce unnecessary configuration complexity

EaseMotion CSS is designed to remain approachable for beginners while still being powerful for advanced developers.

---

# 🤝 Community Vision

EaseMotion CSS is designed as a community-driven but maintainer-curated project.

The goal is to create an ecosystem where:
- Beginners can contribute raw CSS ideas
- Contributors learn real-world design system thinking
- Community experiments evolve into polished framework features
- Documentation stays approachable and beginner-friendly

Community contributions will continue shaping the framework roadmap while maintaining consistent quality standards through maintainer review.

Future community initiatives may include:
- Contributor showcases
- Community animation collections
- Learning resources
- Design challenges
- Open roadmap discussions
 ## Short-Term Roadmap (Next 3 Months)

### Month 1

* Expand core utility classes
* Improve documentation coverage
* Add more real-world examples
* Improve contributor onboarding

### Month 2

* Introduce additional form-related components
* Expand animation utilities
* Improve accessibility testing and validation
* Increase automated quality checks

### Month 3

* Refine component library consistency
* Improve CDN and package distribution experience
* Expand documentation website content
* Prepare for larger community contributions

---

## Scope Boundaries (What Will NOT Be Added)

To preserve the project's philosophy, EaseMotion CSS intentionally avoids:

* Abbreviated utility naming conventions
* Mandatory build steps or compilation requirements
* JavaScript-dependent core functionality
* Large plugin ecosystems that increase complexity
* Multiple competing naming styles
* Features that reduce readability in favor of shorter syntax

These boundaries help maintain a simple, human-readable design language.

---

## Community Vision

EaseMotion CSS aims to grow through thoughtful community collaboration. To support this, we have set up our official **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hWSdGrccBU)** where developers can connect, discuss design systems, seek guidance on submissions, and collaborate on the roadmap.

Contributors are encouraged to:

* Propose new utility classes
* Share examples and use cases
* Improve documentation
* Report bugs and accessibility concerns
* Suggest improvements aligned with project philosophy

The goal is not to become the largest CSS framework, but to become one of the most approachable and readable frameworks for developers of all experience levels.

Community contributions will continue to be reviewed and curated to ensure consistency, quality, and alignment with the EaseMotion vision.
