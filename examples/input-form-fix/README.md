# Sandbox Layout Patch: Input Form Layout Jitter Resolution

## Overview
A precision layout-stabilization patch for input text fields to eliminate runtime layout shifts and text jumping within sandbox form structures.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Interactive multi-field verification sheet showcasing crisp focus animations with zero downstream line movement.
* `style.css` — Token-mapped stylesheet locking the elements' physical box model bounds and offloading focus outlines to paint layers.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, moving an input field into an active focused state applied a rigid `border: 2px` configuration on top of a `1px` baseline. This increase modified the actual physical layout dimensions of the input box, causing the browser to trigger a full layout reflow. This reflow pushed adjacent form fields and descriptive captions downward by $1\text{px}$ to $2\text{px}$, creating a distracting interface jitter.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The input boundaries are secured. By locking the physical border element permanently at `1px` and utilizing layered `box-shadow` configurations (`inset` combined with outer glows) during focus states, the active highlight is managed entirely on the browser's paint layer. This achieves a rich, thick focus ring style while keeping element layout metrics perfectly locked.
