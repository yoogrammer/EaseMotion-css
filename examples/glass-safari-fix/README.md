# Sandbox Layout Fix: Safari Glassmorphism Filter Collapse Patch

## Overview
A cross-browser layout patch for glassmorphic interfaces to eliminate WebKit filter dropouts and restore frosted transparency layers on Apple Safari engines.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Dynamic high-contrast mesh background validation field to easily check blur levels.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout overrides injecting explicit vendor-prefixed styling parameters linked back to core variables.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, testing glassmorphic panels inside Apple Safari browsers (WebKit engine) caused the background frosted layer to completely turn off. Safari dropped the standard `backdrop-filter: blur()` statement, painting the item as a flat, dark translucent plate. This failure dropped text contrast levels significantly and left content illegible over busy background graphics.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The canvas layer configuration is stabilized. By placing the explicit vendor engine hook `-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur()` directly preceding the default standard specification instruction, the WebKit rendering path processes the alpha blending matrix cleanly, maintaining consistent, accessible glass depth styling across all platforms.
