# Sandbox Layout Patch: Responsive Image Aspect-Ratio Squishing Resolution

## Overview
A precision sizing-stabilization patch for responsive media containers to prevent image squishing, pixel stretching, and layout reflow distortion across variable grid system channels.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Dynamic verification board loading mixed landscape and portrait photographic assets to evaluate rendering proportions.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout constraints applying strict aspect rules and raster scaling masks linked back to framework core variables.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, populating auto-fitting card blocks with image elements caused visual regression anomalies across adaptive monitor screens. As columns scaled horizontally, browser layout engines repeatedly miscalculated target height constraints, causing headshot avatars and product photography components to stretch or squish out of proportion instead of cropping cleanly.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The media boundaries are secured. By wrapping responsive media assets in a dedicated container carrying an explicit `aspect-ratio` proportion rule (such as `16/9` or `1/1`), the element's layout geometry remains mathematically locked. Combined with an inner `object-fit: cover` macro configuration applied directly to the image node, the engine center-crops overflowing pixel edges gracefully, preserving accurate object proportions across all viewports.
