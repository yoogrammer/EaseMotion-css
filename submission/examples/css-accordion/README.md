# Sandbox Component Showcase: Pure-CSS Collapsible Accordion Panel

## Overview
An accessible, script-free accordion disclosure framework component isolated completely within a sandbox pathway. It utilizes standard semantic markup layers to drive height animation transitions without runtime JavaScript overhead.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Interactive presentation layout managing multi-open FAQ disclosure items.
* `style.css` — Scoped structural style layout implementing checkbox state selectors linked back to core tokens.

## 🚀 Key Layout Mechanics
1. **Implicit Input State Tracking:** Leverages the standard browser behavior where clicking an HTML `<label>` triggers its linked hidden `<input id="...">` token. This provides state tracking natively without relying on JavaScript event loops.
2. **Max-Height Transition Bounds:** To get around the browser engine's inability to animate properties transitioning to or from `height: auto`, this system transitions a protective `max-height` ceiling threshold value cleanly using smooth cubic-bezier vectors.
3. **Responsive Asset Independence:** The component sandbox maintains a small layout footprint, remaining 100% self-contained inside the standalone features path to enforce a complete core feature freeze.
