# Dark Mode Token Layer

## What does this do?

Adds a reusable CSS custom property layer for light and dark themes with both automatic system preference support and manual `data-theme` overrides.

## How is it used?

Use the default token layer for system preference-based theming:

```html
<section class="theme-preview">
  <div class="theme-card">
    <h2>System Theme</h2>
    <p>This follows the user's device preference.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Use manual light mode by applying `data-theme="light"`:

```html
<section class="theme-preview" data-theme="light">
  <div class="theme-card">
    <h2>Manual Light Theme</h2>
    <p>This section always uses light theme tokens.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Use manual dark mode by applying `data-theme="dark"`:

```html
<section class="theme-preview" data-theme="dark">
  <div class="theme-card">
    <h2>Manual Dark Theme</h2>
    <p>This section always uses dark theme tokens.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```
