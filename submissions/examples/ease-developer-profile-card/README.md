## Features

- 🎭 **CSS-Only Theme Switching**: Leverages the power of the `:has()` parent selector to toggle between light and dark modes instantly using radio inputs.
- 🎡 **Rotating Gradient Ring**: An animated vector SVG outline ring that surrounds the developer's avatar, rotating slowly by default and accelerating with a glow effect on hover.
- 🧑‍💻 **Self-Contained Vector Avatar**: Built using fully customizable inline SVGs so there are no broken image placeholders or heavy asset loading times.
- 🏷️ **Interactive Stack Badges**: Responsive technology stack labels that lift, scale, and light up with theme accents on hover.
- 📊 **Contribution Statistics**: Clean grid columns representing repositories, stars, and PRs, designed to emphasize numbers and zoom slightly on mouseover.
- 🌐 **Dynamic Social Buttons**: Icon buttons mapping to GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Dribbble. Hovering triggers smooth shifts and colors matching the official brand identity.
- ⚡ **Staggered Animations**: Fluid load-in animations that transition different card elements consecutively, giving the card a lively introduction.
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive Design**: Clean layouts scaling from small screens (under 375px) up to high-resolution desktop viewports.

- **Inter**: Used for high-legibility body content like roles, bios, and tag texts.

To substitute these fonts, update the font families:
```css
:root {
  --font-heading: 'Your-Heading-Font', sans-serif;
  --font-body: 'Your-Body-Font', sans-serif;
}
```
