# Flexible Component Card Layout & Typographic Stability Bench

A curated showcase layout containing cards, text nodes, and flexible containers. This component is built completely within self-contained submission scopes to validate layout robustness, responsive design token transitions, and strict typographic containment benchmarks under extreme character inputs.

Additionally, this example directory introduces critical patches to resolve text clipping, horizontal layout blowout on narrow viewports, cumulative layout shifts (CLS), and visibility breaks across high-contrast operating system themes.

## 🚀 Key Features & Architectural Patches

- **Defensive Text Overflow Controls:** Solves the issue of massive, unbroken character strings (such as unspaced descriptions, long code lines, or absolute URLs) shattering the geometry of responsive flex and grid cards. 
  - **Multi-Line Word Wrap:** Uses `overflow-wrap: break-word` and `word-break: break-word` on body typography to split continuous strings cleanly onto new lines.
  - **Single-Line Ellipsis Truncation:** Implements a neat single-line text constraint (`text-overflow: ellipsis`) for headers and metadata text to clip gracefully at the card boundary line.
  - **Flex Shrink Guard:** Enforces `min-width: 0` on card containers to override the implicit flex layout auto-minimums, allowing elements to contract smoothly on smaller viewports.
- **Layout Shift Isolation (CLS Mitigation):** Isolates dynamic utility animation nodes inside a dedicated single-cell `inline-grid` stack wrapper. This locks down bounding dimensions to a fixed constraint footprint, meaning toggling animations causes zero layout displacement for neighboring text objects.
- **Dynamic Dark Mode Tokens:** Replaces hardcoded color hex mappings with systemic, scalable design variables (`--ease-bg-surface`, `--ease-color-text`, etc.) ensuring typography boundaries never become invisible or wash out under active dark themes.
- **System-Level Forced Colors Fallbacks:** Integrates specific media profile safeguards (`@media (forced-colors: active)`) to support Windows High Contrast Mode. When system preferences strip away background linear-gradients, the stylesheet maps responsive boundaries using native system palette variables (`CanvasText` and `Canvas`) to guarantee typography legibility.
