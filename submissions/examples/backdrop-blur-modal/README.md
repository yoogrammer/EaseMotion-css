# Sandbox Component Showcase: Pure-CSS Backdrop-Blur Overlay Modal Confirmation Component

## Overview
A zero-dependency, pure-CSS interactive overlay modal panel and frosted glass background blur mask utility isolated within an examples subdirectory. It coordinates display focus state switches natively via standard URL fragment hash lookups, executing visual reveal actions smoothly without launching script listeners.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Interactive presentation user cockpit hosting target anchors and popup nodes to evaluate overlay disclosures.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet establishing isolated custom grid and blurring configurations linked back to global tokens.

## 🚀 Key Layout Mechanics
1. **Hash Routing Overlay Disclosure:** Eliminates the necessity for DOM appending scripts or class modification listening nodes by pairing triggers under the native CSS `:target` pseudo-class algorithm. Toggling anchor fragment addresses expands target views instantly.
2. **GPU-Accelerated Blending Matrices:** Fades the backdrop capsule opacity smoothly from `0` to `1` over clean cubic-bezier coordinates while performing an inline graphic pixel adjustment pass (`backdrop-filter: blur(8px);`). Concurrently, the confirmation panel scales up into view over an elastic spring curve, isolating calculations completely on the browser's hardware painter channels.
3. **Sandbox Compliance Safeguard:** Fully satisfies repository security policies by placing every asset line strictly inside `submissions/examples/backdrop-blur-modal/`.
