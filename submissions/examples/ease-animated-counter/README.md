# ⚡ Ease Animated Counting Number Component

A viewport-aware statistical metric counter component for EaseMotion CSS that animates values smoothly up from zero as they scroll into view.

## ✨ What it does
Utilizes the lightweight Intersection Observer API combined with hardware-accelerated CSS keyframes to dynamically update, scale-pulse, and snap metrics into place the exact moment they cross into the user's active screen viewport.

## 🚀 How to Use
Configure the custom `data-` attributes on your `ease-count-up` elements to set targeting mechanics:

```html
<div class="ease-count-up" 
     data-target="1200" 
     data-prefix="$" 
     data-suffix="+" 
     data-duration="2000">
  0
</div>
