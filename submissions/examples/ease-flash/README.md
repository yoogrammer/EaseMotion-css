# ease-flash

Rapid visibility flicker animation that mimics a camera flash or warning strobe.

## Features

- Opacity sequence: `1 → 0 → 1 → 0 → 1`
- Fast animation (`0.8s`)
- One-shot by default
- Customizable repetition count with `--ease-flash-count`
- Suitable for alerts and notifications

## Usage
