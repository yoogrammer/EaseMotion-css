# Sandbox Component Showcase: Animated Star History Graph

## Overview

A lightweight animated analytics visualization that recreates a GitHub-style star growth chart using pure SVG, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The component progressively draws a smooth contribution curve while revealing chart metadata, legends, and axis labels through coordinated entrance animations.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files

* `demo.html` — Self-contained analytics showcase featuring an animated star history chart rendered entirely with SVG.
* `style.css` — Scoped styling layer responsible for layout, typography, entrance transitions, and chart presentation.

## 🚀 Key Visualization Mechanics

### 1. Progressive SVG Path Drawing

The graph line is animated using SVG stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset techniques. This creates the illusion of the chart being drawn in real time, allowing users to visually follow repository growth trends as the animation progresses.

### 2. Smooth Curve Interpolation

Data points are connected using cubic Bézier curve segments rather than straight lines. This produces a polished analytics-style appearance similar to modern dashboard and data visualization platforms.

### 3. Animated Data Tracking Marker

A highlighted tracking dot follows the active position of the line as it is drawn. The marker provides visual focus and reinforces the relationship between time progression and star growth.

### 4. Staged Information Reveal

Chart elements appear in a deliberate sequence:

* Repository title and icon
* Legend information
* Chart container
* Animated growth curve

This staggered reveal improves visual hierarchy and creates a more engaging onboarding experience.

### 5. Responsive SVG Architecture

The chart is rendered using scalable vector graphics and a fixed viewBox system, ensuring crisp visuals across different screen sizes without requiring image assets or canvas rendering.

### 6. Sandbox-Isolated Implementation

All visualization logic, styling, and rendering remain fully contained within the sandbox submission directory. The component introduces no dependencies, framework requirements, or modifications to the core EaseMotion CSS architecture.

## 🎯 Use Cases

* GitHub repository growth visualizations
* Dashboard onboarding screens
* Analytics landing pages
* SaaS metrics showcases
* Product launch statistics
* Contribution history presentations

## ✨ Why It Fits EaseMotion CSS

This submission focuses on motion-first storytelling through progressive disclosure and lightweight animation techniques. By combining SVG path drawing, smooth easing functions, and staged content reveals, it demonstrates how meaningful data visualizations can be enhanced with expressive motion while remaining simple, readable, and dependency-free.
