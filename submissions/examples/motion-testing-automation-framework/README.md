# Motion Testing Automation Framework

A professional frontend quality-engineering dashboard for automatically validating animation timing systems, accessibility WCAG compliance, rendering frame-rate stability, multi-device viewport consistency, and layout-safe GPU composites execution.

### 1. What does this do?
This is an automated quality assurance console designed to validate web transitions and animations against professional production performance and safety budgets:
- **Automated Motion Validation Engine**: Sequentially executes four integration tests validating key parameters (Accessibility comforts, Performance regressions, Viewport consistency, GPU safety).
- **Realtime Diagnostics Console**: An emulated terminal logger streaming formatted test results, assertions, and warning logs in real-time (Mocha/Jest test reports style).
- **Motion Quality Scoring**: Generates automated compliance, performance, and stability index scores based on active test runs.
- **GPU Safety highlights (DevTools overlay)**: Simulates visual outlines overlaying preview components (Green boundaries highlight composited layer promotions; Red flashing boxes indicate layout reflow zones).
- **Production CSS Validation Exporter**: Generates optimized transition variable templates that adapt to viewports and user motion preferences automatically.

### 2. How is it used?
1. Open [demo.html](demo.html) directly in any web browser.
2. Select target test configurations (e.g. speed factor multipliers, travel offsets, or prefers-reduced-motion states).
3. Click **"Run Automated Tests"** to execute the test suite. Watch the timeline checks spin and resolve into passes (green) or failures (red).
4. Review standard Mocha-style unit assertion statements inside the **Diagnostics Console** terminal.
5. Click **"Toggle DevTools Overlay"** and hover over the preview cards to inspect composite promotions vs reflow hotspots visually.
6. Click **"Copy Validated CSS"** to copy the generated responsive stylesheets to the clipboard.

### 3. Why is it useful?
Web animations frequently cause performance regressions (layout thrashing) and accessibility compliance failures (lack of prefers-reduced-motion support) that go unnoticed during development. Manual verification of transition curves across multiple viewports and preferences is time-consuming and error-prone. This testing framework automates this process by running assertions on CSS parameters, profiling layout vs composite pathways, and verifying WCAG 2.2 safety boundaries, allowing engineering teams to enforce high-quality motion standards automatically in production pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Implementation Details
- **HTML5 & Vanilla CSS3**: Custom grid layout, glassmorphic card containers, and DevTools-style border highlights.
- **Test Assertion Engine**: Math rules that simulate async test suites, track assertions, and write standard CLI reports.
- **Modern Code Exporter**: Real-time CSS compiler formatting variables and media-query structures.
- **Accessibility**: Emulates full OS level media-query integrations for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
