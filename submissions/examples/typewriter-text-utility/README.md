# Typewriter Text Animation Utility ⌨️

A highly performant, typography-first CSS micro-interaction utility component that simulates code editing layout arrays or terminal print loops using strict hardware keyframe transitions.

## Core Features Implemented

- **Monospace Steps Alignment**: Coordinates CSS `steps()` functionality mapping character lengths (`ch` tracking) to prevent standard character clipping artifact trends.
- **Configurable Speed Layers**: Bundles variable custom parameters (`--typewriter-speed`) supporting speed overrides via classes.
- **Infinite Cursor Loop**: Employs a zero-compute `step-end` animation sequence handling smooth caret visibility shifts.

## Base Framework Usage

To optimize character processing boundaries accurately, attach explicit character step length tokens alongside the standard base class:
