# Sandbox Component Showcase: Interactive Floating Action Button (FAB) Speed-Dial Menu

## Overview
A zero-dependency, pure-CSS multi-tier floating speed-dial panel isolated inside an examples subfolder directory. It enables elegant speed-dial selection patterns for application headers or core workspace dashboards without running runtime tracking scripts.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Self-contained user canvas hosting the floating speed-dial array to review active fan-out micro-interactions.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet setting hardware composition limits and structural delay cascades linked back to framework tokens.

## 🚀 Key Layout Mechanics
1. **Checkbox State Management Matrix:** Eliminates main-thread click tracking listeners by utilizing a hidden `input[type="checkbox"]` wrapper. State mutations are monitored natively through the `:checked` pseudo-class.
2. **Staggered Transition Animation Chains:** Leverages custom staggered CSS `transition-delay` parameters across incremental list items (`li:nth-child(n)`). This produces an elegant cascading slide-out effect as secondary nodes exit from behind the parent button.
3. **Sandbox Compliance Safeguard:** Fully satisfies repository security policies by placing every asset line strictly inside `submissions/examples/fab-speed-dial/`.
