# 3D Ease Card Flip Component

A lightweight, high-performance, and responsive 3D card-flipping animation utility built using zero-dependency raw CSS. It delivers a fluid 180-degree transition between a front and back face upon hover.

## Mechanics
This utility relies on modern hardware-accelerated CSS 3D properties:
- `perspective`: Establishes the viewport depth plane.
- `transform-style: preserve-3d`: Mandates child elements retain their coordinate systems in 3D space.
- `backface-visibility: hidden`: Conceals the mirrored reverse texture of the alternate face during rotation.

## Structure
```html
<div class="ease-card-flip">
  <div class="ease-card-flip-inner">
    <div class="ease-card-flip-front">
      </div>
    <div class="ease-card-flip-back">
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
