# Animated Aurora Hero Section

A premium, CSS-only animated hero section for the [EaseMotion CSS](https://github.com/your-org/easemotion-css) open-source animation library. Features flowing aurora background blobs, glassmorphism card styling, staggered entrance animations, and micro-interactive buttons — all with zero JavaScript.

---

## Description

This component delivers a production-ready hero section that feels at home on award-winning landing pages. Five independently animated gradient blobs create a living, breathing aurora effect beneath a glassmorphism content card. Every element enters with a staggered `fade-up` animation, the gradient heading cycles through a soft glow, and both buttons reward hover interactions with deliberate tactile feedback.

The entire experience is driven by CSS custom properties, keyframes, and `backdrop-filter` — no runtime JS, no frameworks, no build step required.

## Features

- **Animated Aurora Background** — Five multi-coloured radial-gradient blobs (violet, cobalt, cyan, teal, magenta) drift independently via CSS keyframe transforms and alternate-direction timing
- **Glassmorphism Card** — `backdrop-filter: blur()` + `saturate()` surface with a translucent border and a top-edge gradient shimmer line
- **Staggered Entrance Animations** — Badge, heading, description, buttons, and metrics each fade and slide up with `--delay` CSS variable offsets
- **Gradient Text Glow** — The accent heading line uses `background-clip: text` with an animated `drop-shadow` filter loop
- **Primary Button** — Full gradient fill, spring-eased lift on hover, animated inner glow, and an arrow that slides right
- **Ghost Button** — Glassmorphism base with a masked gradient border that fades in on hover
- **Responsive** — Three breakpoints (desktop / tablet / mobile) with collapsing button stack, adjusted card padding, and simplified metric layout
- **CSS Only** — Zero JavaScript; zero external frameworks; no build step
- **Motion Safe** — All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` via a single media-query override block

## Usage

### 1. Copy the files

```
animated-aurora-hero-section/
├── demo.html
├── style.css
└── README.md
```

### 2. Link the stylesheet

```html

```

### 3. Drop the markup into your page

Copy the contents of `demo.html`'s `<body>` into your own layout. The aurora stage is `position: fixed` so it tiles the viewport; the hero section itself is `position: relative; z-index: 1`.

### 4. Customise tokens

All colours, radii, spacing, and timing live in `:root` CSS variables at the top of `style.css`. Override them per-page without touching component code:

```css
:root {
  --aurora-a: #6e40c9;   /* blob 1 colour */
  --aurora-b: #1a6cf6;   /* blob 2 colour */
  --col-bg:   #04060f;   /* page background */
  --grad-text: linear-gradient(135deg, #a78bfa, #60a5fa, #22d3ee);
}
```

### 5. Stagger delay helper

The `.animate-fade-up` utility reads a `--delay` inline custom property:

```html
...
```

Chain as many elements as you like with increasing delays for smooth sequential reveals.

## Why it fits EaseMotion CSS

EaseMotion CSS is built on three core principles. This component embodies all three:

### Animation-first

Every visual layer is in motion: aurora blobs use uniquely timed `translate + scale` keyframe sequences, the badge dot pulses, the heading accent glows, the card shimmer animates, and the orbs float. Motion is not decorative afterthought — it *is* the design. The component proves that expressive, multi-layered animation is achievable with pure CSS.

### Human-readable

The CSS is organised in clearly numbered sections (tokens → reset → aurora → hero → buttons → metrics → animations → responsive → reduced-motion). Keyframe names (`aurora-drift-2`, `fade-up-in`, `glow-text`) describe exactly what they do. Utility classes follow a consistent `animate-*` namespace. Any developer can scan the file and understand the animation architecture without reading documentation.

### Composable

Each animation piece is independent and reusable:

|
 Piece 
|
 Reuse 
|
|
---
|
---
|
|
`.aurora-stage`
 + 
`.aurora-blob`
|
 Drop into any page as a full-screen background 
|
|
`.animate-fade-up`
 + 
`--delay`
|
 Apply to any element for staggered entrance 
|
|
`.btn--primary`
 / 
`.btn--ghost`
|
 Standalone button styles 
|
|
`.hero__card`
 glassmorphism 
|
 Any card or modal surface 
|
|
`--grad-text`
 glow heading 
|
 Any display heading 
|

Compositions can be mixed: use the aurora background with a completely different card, or use the button styles in a navigation bar. Nothing is hardcoded to a single parent container.

For browsers without `backdrop-filter` support, the card falls back gracefully to the semi-transparent background colour without blur.
