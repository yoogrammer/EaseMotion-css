# hover-grow-bh

Accessibility enhancement for the `hover-grow` submission.

## What this adds

Adds a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to the hover-grow effect so users who have enabled Reduce Motion in their OS settings are not shown scaling animations.

## How it works

When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is detected, all `transition` and `transform` properties on hover-grow elements are disabled, while the hover effect remains functional.

## Affected elements

- `.hover-grow-card`
- `.hover-grow-btn`
- `.hover-grow-img`
