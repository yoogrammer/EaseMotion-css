# Badges — Reduced Motion Support (Issue #8562)

## Problem

The badges component had a `.ease-badge-pulse` variant with a ping animation but no `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` guard. Users who request reduced motion in their system/browser settings would still see the pulsing animation.

## Solution

Added a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block that:
- Stops the `::after` ping animation entirely (`animation: none; display: none;`)
- Replaces it with a static `box-shadow` ring as a subtle visual indicator

Also includes dark-mode support for the pulse shadow colors.
