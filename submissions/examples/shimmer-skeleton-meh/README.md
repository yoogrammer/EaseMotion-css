# shimmer-skeleton

1. What does this do?
   Creates pure CSS shimmer loading placeholders — the same effect 
   used by Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube while content loads. 
   A light sweep animates across grey placeholder shapes, signalling 
   that real content is on its way.

2. How is it used?
   Apply `skeleton-box` to any div to make it shimmer:
```html
   <!-- Simple text skeleton -->
   <div class="skeleton-box skeleton-line-full"></div>
   <div class="skeleton-box skeleton-line-half"></div>

   <!-- Avatar + text combo -->
   <div class="skeleton-card">
     <div class="skeleton-row">
       <div class="skeleton-avatar"></div>
       <div class="skeleton-lines">
         <div class="skeleton-box skeleton-line-full"></div>
         <div class="skeleton-box skeleton-line-half"></div>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
```
   Add `skeleton-dark` to the card wrapper for dark mode.
   Add `skeleton-slow` or `skeleton-fast` to adjust speed.

3. Why is it useful?
   EaseMotion CSS currently animates elements that are visible — 
   but has nothing for the loading state before content appears. 
   Skeleton loaders are used on virtually every modern production 
   app and fill a real gap in the framework. A single class turns 
   any div into a professional shimmer placeholder instantly, 
   perfectly matching EaseMotion CSS's goal of expressive, 
   utility-first animations.
