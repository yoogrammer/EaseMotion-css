```html
<div class="ease-reveal">Reveals on scroll</div>
<div class="ease-reveal ease-reveal-left">Slides in from right</div>
```

## Browser Support

Requires `animation-timeline: view()` (Chrome 115+, Edge 115+). Falls back gracefully — elements remain fully visible in unsupported browsers.

## Notes

- Combine delay variants for staggered group reveals
- `animation-fill-mode: both` keeps elements visible after animation completes
- Works on any block element without any JavaScript
