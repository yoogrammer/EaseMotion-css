## Available Classes

## Usage

### Basic Text Spacing

```html
<!-- Tight spacing for headlines -->
<h1 class="ease-tracking-tight">Bold Headline</h1>

<!-- Normal spacing for body text -->
<p class="ease-tracking-normal">Body copy remains readable with standard letter spacing.</p>

<!-- Wide spacing for subtle emphasis -->
<p class="ease-tracking-wide">Luxury product descriptions often use wider tracking.</p>

<!-- Widest spacing for dramatic effect -->
<h2 class="ease-tracking-widest">FEATURED</h2>
```

### Combining with Other Utilities

```html
<!-- Use with text size and color utilities -->
<h1 class="ease-tracking-tight ease-text-2xl ease-text-primary">
  Premium Brand Title
</h1>

<!-- Use with padding for styled tags or badges -->
<span class="ease-tracking-wide ease-padding-2 ease-rounded">
  EXCLUSIVE
</span>
```

### Responsive Letter Spacing

The utilities use static values; for responsive behavior, combine with media queries:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  h1 {
    letter-spacing: -0.01em; /* Tighter on mobile */
  }
}
```

## Why is it Useful?

Letter spacing (tracking) is a powerful typography tool often overlooked in CSS frameworks. These utilities make it easy to:

- **Control headline impact** — Use `ease-tracking-tight` to make titles feel bold and modern
- **Improve readability** — Adjust tracking for body text based on font size and design requirements
- **Add brand identity** — Luxury brands often use wider tracking to convey elegance
- **Create visual hierarchy** — Pair with text sizes to make text appear closer or more spacious
- **Enhance accessibility** — Proper tracking improves readability for users with dyslexia

The utilities follow EaseMotion CSS naming conventions (`ease-` prefix, kebab-case) and integrate seamlessly with the framework's design system.
