# Color Theme Architecture Fix

This submission documents and provides the architectural fix for the hardcoded color bug that currently destroys dark mode compatibility across 157 core components.

## Issue Description
Currently, 157 instances across the `core/`, `components/`, and `easemotion/` directories are hardcoding hex colors (e.g., `#FFFFFF`, `#111827`) and `rgb()` values directly into the CSS. This is a severe architectural flaw. By hardcoding static colors instead of utilizing the framework's dynamic CSS Custom Properties, these components are actively blocking the ability to dynamically switch to Dark Mode or apply custom brand themes. If a user toggles Dark Mode, these broken components will remain glaringly bright, rendering the text invisible and completely breaking the UI.

## Proposed Fix
To obliterate this bug and ensure flawless dynamic theming, all hardcoded colors MUST be strictly banned across the entire framework. Instead, components must exclusively map to the centralized CSS Custom Property scale.

### Example

**❌ Incorrect (Current Architecture):**
```css
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff; /* Breaks in Dark Mode! */
  color: #111827;            /* Breaks in Dark Mode! */
}
```

**✅ Correct (New Architecture):**
```css
.card {
  background-color: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-primary);
}
```

The `demo.html` and `style.css` in this folder provide a live, interactive demonstration of this architectural fix, complete with a working Dark Mode toggle. All 157 existing unoptimized components and all future submissions must adopt this exact variable mapping pattern to guarantee framework-wide dark mode and theming compatibility.
