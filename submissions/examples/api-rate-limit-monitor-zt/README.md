# API Rate Limit Monitor (EaseMotion)

A CSS-only dashboard for visualizing API quota usage, reset timers, and warning states.

Purpose
- Provide quick visibility into API usage and remaining quota with animated progress bars and clear metrics.

Use cases
- Developer dashboards showing live or sampled quota usage
- Billing and usage overview pages
- Admin panels for API owners and SRE teams (visual mockups)

Structure
- `section.cards-grid` — responsive grid of `.quota-card` entries
- `article.quota-card` — single quota card with `.metrics`, `.meta-row`, and `.progress` bar
- State classes: `.healthy`, `.warning`, `.danger` to reflect usage thresholds

Customization
- Colors, radii, and shadows are controlled via CSS variables in `style.css` (`:root`).
- Adjust progress percentage by changing the inline `width` on `.progress-fill`.
- Modify thresholds (healthy/warning/danger) by toggling the corresponding classes on `.quota-card` elements.

Accessibility
- Cards are keyboard-focusable and include visible focus outlines.
- All data is presented as text — integrate `aria-live` regions if you connect a real-time backend.

Why it fits EaseMotion CSS
- Lightweight and composable: pairs with EaseMotion utility classes (`em-container`, `em-text-*`) and keeps component CSS minimal and focused.
- Developer-friendly: clear hierarchy, readable metrics, and subtle animations suitable for product dashboards.

Files
- `demo.html` — demo markup with example quota cards.
- `style.css` — component styles (no JS required).
