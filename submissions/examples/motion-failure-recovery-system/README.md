# Motion Failure Recovery System

A professional frontend reliability-engineering dashboard for automatically detecting animation failures, analyzing rendering instability (layout thrashing, dropped frames, state desync), restoring interrupted motion pipelines, and generating resilient CSS recovery workflows.

### 1. What does this do?
This is a professional reliability console designed to detect, diagnose, and recover from transition and animation failures under real-world production conditions:
- **Failure Simulator Panel**: Allows developers to inject frame-rate drops, state interruptions, layout-thrashing reflows, and prefers-reduced-motion queries mismatches.
- **Animation Failure Detection Engine**: Uses a Javascript requestAnimationFrame loop to calculate frame intervals, monitoring for lags (>100ms) or stutters.
- **Resilient Motion Recovery Pipeline**: Restores desynchronized states, resets timing values, overrides reflow properties to GPU composites, and enforces accessibility parameters.
- **Dropped Frame Analyzer**: Renders a live canvas graph mapping frame delta times and highlighting dropped frame spikes.
- **Realtime Diagnostics Console**: An emulated terminal logger streaming Jest-style assertion results and incident recovery steps with timestamps.
- **CSS Exporter HUD**: Generates resilient, copy-pasteable CSS variable configurations that adapt dynamically to any browser throttling or accessibility preference.

### 2. How is it used?
1. Open [demo.html](demo.html) directly in a web browser.
2. Under **"Failure Simulator"**, toggle failures like **"Inject Frame Drops"** or **"Force Layout Jank (CPU Reflow)"**.
3. Hover over the preview card to observe the animation stuttering or thrashing.
4. Review the warning alerts, dropped frame canvas spikes, and diagnostic CLI logs.
5. Click **"Trigger Automatic Recovery"** to run the recovery pipeline. Check that the stability rating restores to 98%+ and the visual heatmap shifts to green.
6. Click **"Copy Recovery CSS"** to copy the generated resilient stylesheet block.

### 3. Why is it useful?
Production web applications are subjected to varying device CPU loads, background browser tab throttling, and heavy layout operations that cause animations to stutter, lag, or stall. Furthermore, silent regression updates can break accessibility fallback configurations. This recovery infrastructure provides a unified developer utility to simulate these incident scenarios, verify frame budget allocations, and automate recovery workflows. By wrapping transitions with fallback composites and timers, it ensures the application remains highly performant and accessible on any device.
