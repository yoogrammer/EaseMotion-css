# Sandbox Layout Fix: CSS Grid Aspect-Ratio Sizing Height Collapse Resolution

## Overview
A structural rendering patch for grid panel templates that completely stops card height compression, resolves layout collapsing, and stabilizes proportional asset geometries inside indefinite height parent grids.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Dynamic dashboard monitoring array grid rendering square component blocks to evaluate ratio boundaries.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet setting explicit grid track row rules linked back to core global tokens.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, utilizing modern proportion modifiers (`aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;`) on item elements inside a layout sheet container bounded by indefinite heights (`min-height: 100%` or flexible layout lanes) caused rendering collapse on Chromium (Blink) engines. Because the engine gets caught in an implicit size calculation loop trying to evaluate dynamic row parameters and element ratios simultaneously, it drops the height check entirely, squashing the layout boxes down to a flat $0\text{px}$ line.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The grid row track parameters are optimized. By replacing loose implicit track calculations with an explicit `grid-template-rows: minmax(min-content, 1fr);` ceiling, you notify the engine's boundary calculator to process the baseline element content space requirements before running fractional updates. This forces browser rendering channels to calculate row sizes accurately, maintaining perfect cell layouts across fluid viewport scales.
