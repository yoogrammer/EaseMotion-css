# Modern CSS Typing Effect Component

A lightweight, high-precision typing and erasing animation component built entirely with pure HTML and CSS. It supports looping multiline text arrays, sequential terminal simulators, custom cursor blinks, and light/dark mode themes.

---

## 1. What does this do?
This component simulates realistic keyboard typing. It features:
- **Zero JavaScript**: Animates characters and caret blinks entirely using CSS `@keyframes` animations.
- **Realistic Typing Orchestration**: Controls typing, cursor blinking on hold, erasing, and looping sequences with precise timing.
- **Perfect Cursor Alignment**: Uses character width units (`ch`) in CSS to dynamically match word lengths, ensuring the cursor blinks precisely at the end of each word.
- **Multiple Layout Modes**:
  - **Hero Suffix Loop**: Alternates words dynamically at the end of a fixed phrase (e.g., "Build websites", "Build interfaces").
  - **IDE Terminal Console**: Types multiple lines of code sequentially.
  - **Status Alert Banner**: Loops system status notifications with live pulsing indicator dots.
- **Adaptive Theme Support**: Styled with CSS variables that adapt automatically to dark and light modes.

## 2. How is it used?

### Layout A: Hero Headline Typing (Alternating Words)
To rotate between phrases, stack them inside a `.ease-typewriter-container` and apply the matching animation classes:

```html
<h2 class="hero-text">
  Build 
  <span class="ease-typewriter-container">
    <!-- Anchor text reserves space for the container, others overlap absolutely -->
    <span class="ease-typewriter-text text-1">modern websites.</span>
    <span class="ease-typewriter-text text-2">fluid interfaces.</span>
    <span class="ease-typewriter-text text-3">motion systems.</span>
  </span>
</h2>
```

### CSS Setup for Custom Words
Define the keyframes for each word, setting the ending width to the character length of the text (`ch` unit):

```css
/* "modern websites." (16 chars) */
@keyframes typing-hero-1 {
  0% { width: 0; border-color: transparent; }
  1% { width: 0; border-color: var(--cursor-color); }
  10% { width: 16ch; border-color: var(--cursor-color); } /* Type in completed */
  12%, 16%, 20% { border-color: transparent; }            /* Blink cursor on hold */
  14%, 18%, 22% { border-color: var(--cursor-color); }
  23% { width: 16ch; border-color: var(--cursor-color); }
  30% { width: 0; border-color: var(--cursor-color); }    /* Erase completed */
  31%, 100% { width: 0; border-color: transparent; }
}

.text-1 {
  animation: typing-hero-1 12s infinite;
}
```

## Class Catalog

| Class Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.ease-typewriter-container` | Container | Relative wrapper that centers and contains typing texts. |
| `.ease-typewriter-text` | Element | Base class that crops text (`overflow: hidden`) and styles the cursor (`border-right`). |
| `.ease-terminal-line` | Element | Monospace terminal line class that types sequentially. |
| `.mock-terminal` | Container | Renders a terminal/IDE mockup with macOS-style window controls. |
| `.status-banner` | Container | Renders a pill-shaped status notification bar. |
| `.status-pulse` | Element | A green/blue status beacon with a ripple animation. |

## 3. Why is it useful?
1. **Zero Script Footprint**: Ideal for fast-loading landing pages and static blogs. It runs natively without loading heavy client-side scripts, maintaining perfect Lighthouse performance.
2. **Engaging UX**: Draws attention to core marketing copy, hero tags, or live status metrics immediately.
3. **No Layout Shift (CLS)**: The relative layout anchor (`.text-1`) reserves the text's vertical height in the document flow. This prevents other content blocks on the page from jumping up or down when typing/erasing.
4. **Accurate Caret Placement**: Animating the width based on character length (`ch`) instead of percentage (`%`) ensures the caret sits snugly against the final character on any monospaced font, avoiding artificial gaps.
5. **Reduced Motion Compliant**: Respects OS-level accessibility settings via `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`, instantly converting the animation to static text for users who prefer low motion.
