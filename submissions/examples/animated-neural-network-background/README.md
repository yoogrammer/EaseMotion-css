# Animated Neural Network Background

> **EaseMotion CSS** — Premium Component Library  
> `animated-neural-network-background`

## Description

A fully CSS-only, animated neural network background component designed as a premium Hero section. It renders a field of glowing nodes connected by data-flow lines against a deep dark background with soft radial blobs, all layered beneath a glassmorphic hero card containing a badge, headline, description, and two CTAs.

It is built to feel at home alongside products from OpenAI, Anthropic, Apple, or Linear — premium, clean, purposeful, and alive without being distracting.

## Features

- **CSS Only** — Zero JavaScript, zero dependencies, zero build step
- **Responsive** — Desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints with carefully adjusted layouts and node/line density
- **Animated Nodes** — 36+ individually staggered pulsing glowing circles across the scene
- **Data Flow Lines** — Gradient-animated connection lines simulating live data traversal
- **Glassmorphism** — Backdrop-blur badge, ghost button, and frosted-glass depth throughout
- **Background Blobs** — Four large radial-gradient blobs that slowly drift to create atmospheric depth
- **Fade-in & Slide-up Hero** — Staggered CSS entrance animations for every hero element
- **Accent Gradient Animation** — The word "Connected" shifts through a blue→purple→cyan cycle
- **Glow Animations** — Badge border pulses, node box-shadows breathe, buttons glow on hover
- **Accessible** — Full `prefers-reduced-motion` support: all animations disabled, static fallback rendered

## Usage

**1. Copy the files into your project:**

```bash
cp demo.html   your-project/
cp style.css   your-project/
```

**2. Link the stylesheet in your HTML `<head>`:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

**3. Add the component markup:**

Paste the `.nn-scene` element (with all its children) into your page body. The component is self-contained — all nodes, lines, blobs, and hero content live inside `.nn-scene`.

**4. (Optional) Customise design tokens in `style.css`:**

```css
:root {
  --nn-blue:          #2563eb;   /* Primary blue  */
  --nn-purple:        #7c3aed;   /* Primary purple */
  --nn-cyan:          #06b6d4;   /* Primary cyan  */
  --nn-speed-blob:    18s;       /* Blob drift speed */
  --nn-speed-node:    3.4s;      /* Node pulse speed */
  --nn-speed-data:    4s;        /* Data flow speed  */
}
```

All visual behaviour is controlled via CSS variables — no need to touch layout code.

## Why It Fits EaseMotion CSS

EaseMotion CSS is built around three core principles. This component was designed with each of them in mind from the first line of code:

### 1. Animation-First

Every element in this component exists to *move*. The nodes breathe. The lines carry data. The blobs drift. The hero text enters the stage with choreography. Motion is not a layer added on top of a static design — it is the design. The `@keyframes` are the primary building blocks; the layout and colour exist to frame them.

### 2. Human-Readable

Every CSS variable, class name, and keyframe is named to describe what it *is* and what it *does* in plain English: `nn-node-pulse`, `nn-data-flow`, `nn-hero-enter`, `nn-blob-drift`. A developer reading this file for the first time can understand the intent of any rule without a comment. Where a comment adds value beyond the name itself, it is there — but the names carry the meaning first.

### 3. Composable

The component is layered into independent, self-contained zones: `.nn-blobs`, `.nn-connections`, `.nn-nodes`, `.nn-vignette`, `.nn-hero`. Each layer can be removed, replaced, or restyled without breaking the others. The design tokens in `:root` form a shared vocabulary that any layer reads from. A developer can swap the hero content for their own, add more nodes by copying a single `<div>`, or change the entire colour scheme by editing five variables. That is composability — the architecture invites extension rather than resisting it.
