# Card Flex Architecture Feature

Introduces the layout standard for base card setups. By explicitly adopting flex directions, structural modifications apply clean vertical expansions without crashing nearby component nodes.

## Usage
Simply wrap content parts directly within structural definitions. The system takes care of layout alignment:
```html
<div class="ease-card">
  <div class="ease-card-body">Main Context</div>
</div>
