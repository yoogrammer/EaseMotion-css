# Unified Focus Ring Architecture

## What does this do?
Proposes a global CSS variable (`--ease-focus-ring`) and utility classes (`.ease-focus-visible`, `.ease-focus-outline`) to establish a single, accessible source of truth for keyboard focus states across the framework.

## How is it used?
Component authors remove hardcoded `outline: 2px solid` or custom `box-shadow` styles from their `:focus-visible` pseudo-classes. Instead, they apply `box-shadow: var(--ease-focus-ring)` to ensure perfect visual consistency.

## Why is it useful?
Currently, interactive elements across `components/buttons.css`, `components/cards.css`, `components/tabs.css`, and `components/navbar.css` handle keyboard focus entirely differently. Some use thin borders, some use outlines, and others rely on `:focus-within` with inconsistent offsets. This fragmented approach harms accessibility and makes the library look disjointed for keyboard navigators. Introducing a global `--ease-focus-ring` utility guarantees that every interactive element provides a highly-visible, brand-aligned, and strictly consistent focus indicator.
