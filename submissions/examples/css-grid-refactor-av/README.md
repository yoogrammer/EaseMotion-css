# CSS Grid Architecture Refactor

## What does this do?
Proposes a complete architectural migration away from legacy, hacky `flex-wrap` and `float`-based layouts in favor of modern, robust **CSS Grid** (`display: grid`) across all 2D component layouts within the framework.

## How is it used?
Maintainers must audit and locate all complex 2D layouts (such as footers, masonry grid fallbacks, and card groups) that currently use `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;` combined with manual `flex-basis` math. 

These legacy patterns must be completely ripped out and replaced with native CSS Grid:
```css
.ease-footer-links {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

## Why is it useful?
Currently, core layout files like `footer.css`, `cards.css`, and `masonry.css` rely heavily on extremely complex Flexbox wrapping mechanisms. While Flexbox is phenomenal for 1D (single row or single column) layouts, it fundamentally struggles with 2D spatial alignment. When a user dynamically injects an odd number of items into an EaseMotion footer or card group, the legacy Flexbox implementation attempts to calculate widths using `flex: 1 1 200px`, which frequently results in the final item stretching massively across the entire bottom row, or columns becoming severely misaligned. By upgrading these core files to use native `display: grid`, the framework gains rock-solid, predictable 2D alignment natively in the browser, completely eliminating these overflow and wrapping bugs without requiring JavaScript masonry libraries.
