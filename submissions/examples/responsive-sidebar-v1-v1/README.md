# 📱 Responsive Sidebar Component (EaseMotion CSS)

## 🚀 Overview

This contribution adds a **responsive sidebar layout** for mobile and desktop screens using EaseMotion CSS.

The goal is to fix the issue where the sidebar overlaps or hides the main content on smaller screens by introducing a **mobile-friendly collapsible sidebar with a hamburger menu**.

## 🐞 Problem

On mobile viewports (`< 768px`):

* Sidebar overlaps main content
* Content gets clipped on the right side

---

## ✅ Solution

This implementation provides:

* A **fixed sidebar** for desktop screens
* A **collapsible sidebar** for mobile devices
* A **hamburger toggle button** to open/close sidebar
* Proper spacing so main content remains fully visible
