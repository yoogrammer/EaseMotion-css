# Animation Re-render Behavior Guide

## Overview

This example demonstrates how animation utilities can behave during component re-renders in dynamic applications.

## Problem

Animations may restart when utility classes are reapplied during re-renders, causing:

* Unwanted visual effects
* Poor user experience
* Inconsistent animation behavior

## Restart Condition Example

```html
<div class="ease-fade-in">
  Animated Content
</div>
```

Repeated rendering may replay the animation unexpectedly.

## Recommended Approach

Apply animation utilities only when an animation should intentionally start.

```html
<div class="ease-fade-in">
  Animated Content
</div>
```

Avoid repeatedly reapplying animation classes during updates.

## Framework Validation

### React

```jsx
function Card() {
  return (
    <div className="ease-fade-in">
      React Content
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Next.js

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="ease-slide-up">
      Next.js Content
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Vue

```vue
<template>
  <div class="ease-bounce">
    Vue Content
  </div>
</template>
```

## Benefits

* Improved UX
* Reduced unnecessary animation playback
* More predictable animation behavior
