# Context-Aware `@container` Queries Architecture

## What does this do?
Proposes a massive architectural leap in framework responsive design by aggressively deprecating legacy `@media` viewport queries inside the `components/` directory, completely replacing them with modern, context-aware CSS `@container` queries.

## How is it used?
Maintainers and core contributors must systematically audit all structural component files—specifically targeting `components/cards.css`, `components/masonry.css`, `components/footer.css`, and `components/navbar.css`. 

Currently, developers are dangerously hardcoding responsive breakpoints based purely on the physical size of the user's browser window:
```css
/* ❌ BAD: Breaks entirely if placed inside a narrow sidebar on a large desktop monitor */
.ease-card { display: flex; flex-direction: row; }
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .ease-card { flex-direction: column; }
}
```

These legacy rules must be completely ripped out and migrated to CSS Container Queries, allowing components to dynamically adapt based exclusively on the width of their immediate parent wrapper:
```css
/* ✅ GOOD: Truly modular. Adapts perfectly whether in a 300px sidebar or a mobile phone screen */
@container (max-width: 500px) {
  .ease-card { flex-direction: column; }
}
```

## Why is it useful?
Currently, EaseMotion is functionally broken for building complex enterprise dashboards. If an enterprise developer builds a beautiful, horizontal responsive card using EaseMotion, and then actively places that card inside a narrow 300px sidebar on a massive 4K desktop monitor, the layout completely shatters. Because the framework relies entirely on `@media (max-width: 768px)`, the card incorrectly thinks it has plenty of space (because the computer monitor is huge) and attempts to render horizontally, violently overflowing and breaking the sidebar.

By completely migrating the framework's core layout components to native CSS `@container` queries, components become truly "context-aware" and fully modular. A card will instantly and natively stack itself vertically if it is squeezed into a tight space, completely regardless of the user's overall screen size. This unlocks infinitely complex dashboard layouts and dramatically reduces the need for enterprise developers to write massive CSS overrides just to use components in tight columns.
