## Why it fits EaseMotion CSS

- **Reusable UI pattern** — The testimonials grid is a common component; drop it into any page with the self-contained `tm-obs` prefix.
- **Elegant hover interactions** — Gold accent reveal, quote glow, and background shift demonstrate EaseMotion's focus on purposeful, tasteful motion.
- **Human-readable classes** — Descriptive naming (`tm-obs-card`, `tm-obs-stars`, `tm-obs-verified`) makes the markup self-documenting.
- **Animation-first philosophy** — The verified-badge pulse (`tmObsPulse`) and hover transitions showcase CSS-only animation aligned with EaseMotion's core identity.
