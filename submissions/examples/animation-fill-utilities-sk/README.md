# Animation Fill Mode Utilities

A set of utility classes to control the `animation-fill-mode` of elements in **EaseMotion CSS**. These utilities are essential for ensuring that elements retain their final animation state or properly apply initial styles before an animation starts.

## Utility Classes

| Class | CSS Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.ease-fill-none` | `animation-fill-mode: none` | Default behavior. No styles applied before or after animation. |
| `.ease-fill-forwards` | `animation-fill-mode: forwards` | Element retains styles from the last keyframe after animation ends. |
| `.ease-fill-backwards` | `animation-fill-mode: backwards` | Element applies styles from the first keyframe during delay. |
| `.ease-fill-both` | `animation-fill-mode: both` | Combines both `forwards` and `backwards` behaviors. |

## How to Use
1. Include `easemotion.css` in your project.
2. Apply an animation class (e.g., `.ease-fade-in`).
3. Add the desired fill-mode utility class.

```html
<!-- Retain visibility after fading in -->
<div class="ease-fade-in ease-fill-forwards">
  Success Message
</div>
```
