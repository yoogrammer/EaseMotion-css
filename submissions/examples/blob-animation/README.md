# Sandbox Component Showcase: Organic Animated Blob

## Overview

A fluid, organic blob animation built with SVG path morphing, gradient fills, ambient particles, and layered glow effects. The shape continuously evolves through independently oscillating control points, creating a natural liquid-like motion without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files

* `demo.html` — Self-contained blob animation showcase including SVG morphing, glow layers, decorative contour lines, and floating particles.
* `style.css` — Scoped styling layer controlling gradients, glow effects, particle motion, positioning, and visual presentation.

## 🚀 Key Animation Mechanics

### 1. Procedural Blob Morphing

The blob is generated from multiple anchor points arranged around a circular base. Each point oscillates independently using sinusoidal radius and angular offsets, producing continuously changing organic shapes.

### 2. Smooth Curve Interpolation

Anchor points are connected using Catmull-Rom to Bézier conversion, creating smooth transitions between points and eliminating sharp geometric edges. This gives the blob its fluid appearance.

### 3. Dual-Layer Glow System

A blurred duplicate of the main blob sits behind the primary shape. This layer amplifies the gradient colors and creates a soft atmospheric glow that follows every morphing movement.

### 4. Animated Inner Contour

A secondary ghost path renders inside the blob as a decorative contour line. It morphs independently at a smaller scale, adding depth and visual complexity to the animation.

### 5. Dynamic Gradient Surface

The blob uses a multi-color gradient fill that shifts naturally across the changing shape. Combined with highlights and glow layers, the effect resembles a living liquid surface.

### 6. Ambient Particle Environment

Floating particles move around the scene using randomized drift values. These subtle background elements reinforce the organic atmosphere and provide additional motion throughout the composition.

### 7. Performance-Oriented SVG Rendering

The animation relies on SVG path updates and GPU-friendly transforms rather than heavy image assets or canvas effects, keeping the component lightweight and scalable.

### 8. Sandbox-Isolated Architecture

All rendering logic, animations, and styling remain fully contained within the sandbox directory. The feature introduces no dependencies and does not modify any core EaseMotion CSS functionality.
