# Sandbox Layout Fix: Custom Geometric Clip-Path Polygon Card Box-Shadow Truncation Resolution

## Overview
A high-performance structural layering patch for clipped vector elements to completely restore ambient drop shadows, stop bounding edge truncation flaws, and enforce reliable depth mapping across custom polygon profiles.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Interactive user cockpit hosting diagonal slant layout elements to check shape alpha filtering paths.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout modifier asset layer shifting shadow calculations from absolute box bounding models over onto parent vector graphic filters linked back to global tokens.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, applying a customized geometric clipping mask onto an absolute element card container using vector path declarations (`clip-path: polygon(...)`) triggered critical layer display breakdown errors. Because standard `box-shadow` properties project pixels strictly outside the structural layout grid, the browser painter thread treats shadow coordinates as external space overflow. The clipping engine truncates those pixels flatly against the interior edges of the path vectors, stripping away depth structures entirely.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The box model stacking and element rendering channels are optimized. By stripping out dead `box-shadow` configurations and nesting the clipped component child inside an explicit static parent hull wrapper assigned with an alpha-channel graphics filter rule (`filter: drop-shadow(...);`), you force the engine to calculate ambient ambient depth arrays based on the final vector canvas shape. Drop shadows map fluidly along the custom slanted angles natively across all viewports without using calculation scripts.
