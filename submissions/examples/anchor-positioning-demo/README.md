# Anchor Positioning Demo

## What does this do?
Demonstrates CSS anchor positioning using `anchor()` and `position-anchor` for tooltip placement.

## How is it used?
Define `anchor-name` on the target and use `anchor()` in the positioned element:

    #anchor { anchor-name: --my-anchor; }
    .tooltip { position-anchor: --my-anchor; top: anchor(bottom); }

## Why is it useful?
Enables robust relative positioning without JavaScript for tooltips, popovers, and menus.
