# Sandbox Layout Fix: Sticky Side-Panel Accessibility Zoom Resolution

## Overview
A performance and layout accessibility patch for sticky dashboard elements to completely stop layout snapping, resolve bounding box clipping, and prevent interface collisions during browser font-magnification changes.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Self-contained dual-column dashboard simulation utilizing custom text-scaling injection triggers to test boundary alignment.
* `style.css` — Scoped modifier asset layer declaring modern inline container context guidelines linked back to framework tokens.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, nesting a side-panel utilizing fixed sticky positioning coordinates (`position: sticky; top: 1rem;`) inside an active layout row caused critical rendering bugs during accessibility text-zoom magnification events. Because browser layout engines scale font sizes much faster than position rendering constraints can re-compute container boundaries, the expanding text elements would spill out, causing sidebars to wobble out of alignment and clip adjacent columns.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The layout reflow parameters are optimized. By wrapping components inside a layout boundary container set to `container-type: inline-size;`, you isolate text sizing calculations from global viewport metrics. Injected metrics configure internal panel text properties via container query length units (`cqw`), forcing font sizing thresholds to compute simultaneously with the container box bounds. This keeps layout tracks completely aligned across all text magnification changes.
