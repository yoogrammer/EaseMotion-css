# Badge Component

A lightweight, theme-aware badge component system for status labels, tags, counters, and indicators.

---

## What does this do?

This submission adds a simple, composable CSS badge system powered by the .ease-badge core class and a set of color and layout modifiers.

The current implementation includes:
- neutral, success, warning, danger, primary, secondary, and info badges
- responsive demo layouts for status labels, notifications, product tags, feature chips, and mobile previews
- dark mode-aware demo styling
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for users who prefer reduced animation

---

## How is it used?

Copy `style.css` into the framework payload or import it as a standalone component.

### Basic usage

```html
<span class="ease-badge">Default</span>
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-success">Success</span>
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-danger">Danger</span>
```

### Optional variants

```html
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-primary">Primary</span>
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-secondary">Secondary</span>
<span class="ease-badge ease-badge-info">Info</span>
```

### Composing multiple badges

```html
<div class="badge-preview">
  <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-success">Online</span>
  <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-warning">Limited</span>
  <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-danger">Out of Stock</span>
</div>
```
