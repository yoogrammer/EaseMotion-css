# Animated Hamburger Menu Toggle (`ease-hamburger`)

A lightweight, performance-first navigational micro-interaction utility component that transforms a standard 3-line horizontal hamburger stack smoothly into an intersection cross ('X') state without using image resources or layout reflow steps.

## Technical Execution Layout

- **Synchronized Axis Morphing:** Arranges three standalone `span` blocks using absolute element dimensions. The top and bottom line tracks combine vertical translations (`translate3d`) along with mirror rotation pivots (`45deg` / `-45deg`) to lock perfectly in the center vector box framework.
- **Asynchronous Element Collapse:** The middle line anchor handles state shifts by combining `opacity: 0` alongside full horizontal collapsing scale factors (`scale3d(0,1,1)`), preventing rendering layout overlap issues.
- **Compositor Path Optimizations:** Runs operations 100% via hardware compositor channels (`transform` and `opacity`) inside a `will-change` layer boundary, rendering fluid transitions at a locked 60fps across mobile and tablet browsers.
