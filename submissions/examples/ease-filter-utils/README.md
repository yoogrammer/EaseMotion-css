# ease-filter utilities

Element-level CSS `filter` utilities for blur, brightness, and grayscale effects on images and other content.

## Class reference

| Class | CSS Value | Visual Effect |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| `.ease-blur-sm` | `blur(4px)` | Light soft blur |
| `.ease-blur` | `blur(8px)` | Medium blur |
| `.ease-blur-lg` | `blur(16px)` | Strong blur |
| `.ease-brightness-50` | `brightness(0.5)` | Half brightness, darker image |
| `.ease-grayscale` | `grayscale(1)` | Full grayscale (black and white) |
| `.ease-grayscale-0` | `grayscale(0)` | Removes grayscale, restores color |

## Usage

```html
<img class="ease-grayscale grayscale-hover" src="photo.svg" alt="Hover to restore color">
```

```css
.grayscale-hover {
  transition: filter 0.3s ease;
}
.grayscale-hover:hover {
  filter: grayscale(0); /* same as .ease-grayscale-0 */
}
```

## Combining filters

Multiple filters can be combined by stacking `filter` values in a custom inline style or a custom class:

```html
<img style="filter: blur(2px) brightness(0.7) grayscale(0.5);" src="photo.svg" alt="Combined">
```

## Element vs backdrop

These utilities apply `filter` to the element itself. This is different from `backdrop-filter` (such as `.ease-backdrop-blur`), which blurs or modifies what appears **behind** the element. Use element-level filters to style photos, icons, and cards; use backdrop filters for glassmorphism overlays.
