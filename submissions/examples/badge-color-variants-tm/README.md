# Badge Color Variants

## What does this do?
Adds info, warning, and neutral color variants to the existing badge
component, alongside the existing primary, danger, and success variants.

## How is it used?
Add the new variant class to a `.ease-badge` element:

    <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-info">3</span>
    <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-warning">!</span>
    <span class="ease-badge ease-badge-neutral">12</span>

## Why is it useful?
The framework defines `--ease-color-info`, `--ease-color-warning`, and
`--ease-color-neutral-600` design tokens but the badge component did not
expose them as named classes. This submission adds the missing variants
so badges can communicate status without inline color overrides.

## Tech Stack

  variants is mirrored here
