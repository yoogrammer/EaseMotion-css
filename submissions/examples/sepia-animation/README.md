# sepia() Animation

## What does this do?

Animates the CSS `sepia()` filter — cycling from full color (0) to vintage sepia (1), with hover-triggered sepia effects at different intensities.

## How is it used?

```css
.element { filter: sepia(0); transition: filter 0.3s; }
.element:hover { filter: sepia(1); }

/* Or with keyframes */
@keyframes sepia-cycle {
  0%, 100% { filter: sepia(0); }
  50%      { filter: sepia(1); }
}
```

## Why is it useful?

The sepia filter adds a warm, nostalgic tone to images and UI elements — commonly used in photography portfolios, vintage-themed designs, and mood boards. Animating sepia creates engaging hover reveals and atmospheric transitions without needing image assets. This fits EaseMotion CSS's aim to make visual effects simple and declarative.
