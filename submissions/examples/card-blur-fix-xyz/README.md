# Hardware-Stabilized Hover Elevation & Vector Layer Bench

A high-fidelity showcase repository module containing interactive element blocks, layouts, and cards designed to transition gracefully across layout elevation levels. This component is optimized completely within self-contained submission scopes to resolve subpixel text pixelation, anti-aliasing weight shifts, and rendering trails during GPU-driven viewport scale transitions.

Additionally, this example folder acts as a bug patch to enforce safe rasterization baselines across Blink, WebKit, and Gecko browser engines.

## 🚀 Key Features & Architectural Patches

- **Compositor Channel Isolation:** Implements explicit layer promotion configurations (`will-change: transform`). This informs the layout engine to handle scale and transition states on a dedicated composition layer, bypassing main-thread font recalculations.
- **Permanent Raster Matrix Pinning:** Enforces a 3D hardware matrix translation (`transform: translateZ(0)`). This prevents the graphics processor from dropping vector resolution models down to dynamic viewport dimensions mid-flight, keeping elements sharp.
- **Backface Rendering Protection:** Binds backface plane parameters (`backface-visibility: hidden`) directly to the layout node, completely eliminating text "shaking" or micro-snapping artifacts upon transition completion loops.
- **Advanced Anti-Aliasing Smoothing Rules:** Overrides native browser text smoothing models (`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`) to preserve balanced typographic contrast under alternative dark/light design tokens.
- **Adaptive System Interactivity Guardrails:** Pairs accessible focus boundaries cleanly with structural hover maps (`:focus-visible`), while automatically neutralizing scaling loops down to static definitions if system preference checks (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`) are verified.
