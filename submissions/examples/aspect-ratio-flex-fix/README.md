# Sandbox Layout Fix: Flexbox Cross-Axis Sizing Aspect-Ratio Distortion Resolution

## Overview
A structural layout patch for flexible row grids to completely eliminate cross-axis card distortion, stop layout stretching conflicts, and stabilize proportional element dimensions inside dynamic flex tracks.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Cross-browser presentation workspace layout hosting a multi-card feed to evaluate aspect ratio calculation boundaries.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet establishing high-performance alignment overrides linked back to global variables.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, nesting card components carrying explicit proportion bounds (`aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;`) inside an active Flexbox row block (`flex-direction: row;`) caused critical user-interface distortion stutters on Chromium (Blink) engines. Because row items inherit a default alignment setting of `align-items: stretch;`, the browser forces all elements to match the height of the tallest card in that row. When text-heavy containers expand vertically, the browser stretches the aspect-locked child as well, breaking its aspect ratio rules and distorting the card geometry.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The layout alignment tracks are optimized. By injecting `align-self: flex-start;` directly onto the active proportional card container item, you override the parent container's implicit cross-axis stretching pass. This allows the layout engine to calculate the box height strictly via its horizontal grid width allocation and aspect ratio formula, keeping the card graphics crisp across fluid responsive viewpoints.
