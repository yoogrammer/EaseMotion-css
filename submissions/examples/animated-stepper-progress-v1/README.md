# Animated Stepper Progress Component

A production-grade, animated stepper progress component for the **EaseMotion CSS** open-source library. Built entirely with HTML and CSS — no JavaScript, no frameworks, no dependencies.

---

## Description

The Animated Stepper Progress Component communicates multi-phase workflows in a visually compelling way. It presents five named steps — Planning, Design, Development, Testing, and Launch — with distinct visual states for completed, active, and upcoming phases.

The design language draws from **glassmorphism**, using frosted translucent cards against a deep dark background with soft indigo-violet gradient accents. Every interaction — from hover lifts to connector fills — is handled exclusively through CSS keyframes and transitions.

---

## Features

- **Responsive** — horizontal on desktop, adaptive on tablet, vertical on mobile
- **Animated Stepper** — staggered fade/slide entrance per step with spring easing
- **Hover Effects** — card lift, glow rings, shimmer sweep, gradient border rotation
- **Glassmorphism** — translucent cards, soft shadows, blur-backed blobs
- **CSS Only** — zero JavaScript, zero external frameworks
- **Accessible** — respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, uses `aria-current="step"`, semantic HTML
- **Composable** — every animation is a standalone `@keyframes` rule, easy to mix and match
- **Dark mode ready** — designed natively for dark backgrounds with CSS custom properties

---

## Usage

1. Copy the component folder into your project:

```
animated-stepper-progress/
├── demo.html
├── style.css
└── README.md
```

2. Link the stylesheet in your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

3. Copy the `.stepper` block from `demo.html` into your page.

4. Set the current active step using the `step--active` class, completed steps with `step--completed`, and future steps with `step--upcoming`.

5. Control stagger timing via the `--step-index` CSS custom property on each `.step`:

```html
<article class="step step--active" style="--step-index: 2;">
```

### Step State Classes

| Class            | Description                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `step--completed`| Step is finished. Shows checkmark.  |
| `step--active`   | Current step. Pulsing ring + glow.  |
| `step--upcoming` | Not yet started. Muted appearance.  |

## Why It Fits EaseMotion CSS

EaseMotion CSS is built on three core principles: **animation-first**, **human-readable**, and **composable**. This component embodies each one:

### Animation-First

Animations are not decorative afterthoughts — they carry semantic meaning. The connector line `connectorFill` animation signals progress direction. The `pulsing` ring on the active step draws the eye naturally to the current state. The staggered `stepEntrance` sequence guides the viewer through the workflow in reading order.

### Human-Readable

Every `@keyframes` name describes what it does in plain English: `checkPop`, `glowPulse`, `shimmerSweep`, `progressExpand`. Any developer reading the CSS immediately understands the intent without needing comments. CSS custom properties like `--dur-slow`, `--ease-spring`, and `--grad-active` make the design tokens self-explanatory.

### Composable

Each animation is a self-contained `@keyframes` block. `slideUpFade` can be dropped onto any element. `pulsing` works on any circular element. `connectorFill` applies to any progress indicator. The step state classes (`step--completed`, `step--active`, `step--upcoming`) are independent modifiers that compose cleanly with the base `.step` component. Timing is coordinated through a single `--stagger` variable, so adjusting the entire entrance sequence takes one line.

## CSS Custom Properties

All design tokens are exposed as CSS variables on `:root` for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --grad-primary:   /* main indigo-purple gradient */
  --grad-active:    /* active state gradient */
  --grad-completed: /* completed state gradient */
  --circle-size:    /* step circle diameter */
  --radius-card:    /* card border radius */
  --dur-slow:       /* standard animation duration */
  --ease-spring:    /* spring easing curve */
  --stagger:        /* per-step entrance delay */
}
```

---

## Browser Support

All modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties, `@keyframes`, and `backdrop-filter`. Degrades gracefully in older browsers (animations simply won't play; layout and content remain intact).
