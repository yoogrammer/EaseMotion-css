# Mobile-Responsive Documentation Layout

This example demonstrates how to build a modern, responsive documentation layout using a mobile-first approach. It patches issues where static sidebars squish textual content windows on compact screen sizes.

## Files Included
- `demo.html`: Core semantic DOM structures for a sidebar and content frame.
- `style.css`: Layout control properties utilizing fluid flexbox structures with an adaptive media query breakpoint block at `768px`.

## Layout Mechanics
- **Mobile Viewports (< 768px):** The left desktop sidebar converts seamlessly into a top-flowing structural layout wrap, preventing horizontal grid shrinking.
- **Desktop Viewports (>= 768px):** The sidebar transitions smoothly into a fixed vertical navigation dock pinned to the left column.
