# Sandbox Layout Fix: Flexbox Truncation Text Blowout Resolution

## Overview
A structural rendering fix for flexible container rows to prevent text blowouts, fix viewport width leaks, and ensure text truncation triggers correctly inside nested flex layers.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Interactive presentation container using a toggle utility to scale flex container tracks dynamically.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout modifier asset layer overriding default implicit min-size rules.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, nesting a long, unbroken string of text (such as a database hash, tracking URL, or crypto token) inside an element with `text-overflow: ellipsis` that lives as a child of a Flexbox row grid caused rendering failures. Because flex child nodes carry an implicit minimum measurement setting of `min-width: auto;`, the browser prioritizes the un-wrapped, natural thickness of the raw text string over the bounds of the parent container. This completely bypasses your clipping parameters, stretching and blowing out parent panels.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The item dimensions are stabilized. By applying `min-width: 0;` onto the active intermediate flex box column wrapper, the browser drops the content thickness calculation requirement. This gives the layout engine explicit permission to compress the container wrapper down to match its assigned track space, allowing text ellipses to truncate safely during dynamic view updates.
