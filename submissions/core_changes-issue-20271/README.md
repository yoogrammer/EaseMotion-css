# Core Changes Proposal: Issue #20271

## Feature Overview
Issue #20271 requests a **Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Platform** showcase example demonstrating EaseMotion CSS's capability for complex enterprise dashboards.

The showcase features a double-sidebar layout with 6 core sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Threat Monitoring** | Live threat feed with severity badges, source IPs, and real-time timestamps |
| **Vulnerability Management** | Severity breakdown with animated progress bars and finding counts |
| **Incident Response** | Active incidents with status, SLA timer, and escalation matrix |
| **Attack Surface Analytics** | Surface area metrics, exposed ports, and risk heatmap |
| **Compliance Tracking** | Framework compliance scores (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA) |
| **Security Posture** | Overall posture score with trend indicator and category breakdown |

## Design Approach
- **Double-sidebar layout**: Left sidebar for navigation + quick filters, right sidebar for alert feed and mini-stats
- **Dark enterprise theme** with crimson/amber/cyan color tokens for threat severity
- **Staggered entrance animations** using `--i` custom property delays
- **Glassmorphism cards** with `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Pulse animations** on critical threats and active incidents
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` respected
- Zero JavaScript, pure CSS

## Why this is submitted here
Per CONTRIBUTING.md policy and Core Framework Protection, this feature is proposed as a formal submission in `submissions/` rather than modifying `core/` or `components/` directly.

Fixes #20271
