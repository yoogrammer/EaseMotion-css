# Sandbox Layout Fix: Horizontal Row-Reverse Scroll Origin Disalignment Resolution

## Overview
A typographic rendering patch for horizontally scrolling tracks to fix initial viewport disalignment, resolve scrollbar position detachment, and ensure correct alignment on WebKit viewports.

## 📁 Sandbox Configuration Files
* `demo.html` — Chronological real-time data streaming layout rendering overflowing grid items to evaluate load positions.
* `style.css` — Scoped layout sheet swapping physical layout direction parameters for logical text-direction matrices.

## 🐛 The Bug Resolved
Previously, utilizing `flex-direction: row-reverse;` on an overflowing container (`overflow-x: auto;`) to build reverse tracking streams (like timeline cards, or logging tracks) caused severe presentation layout defects in Safari. Because the WebKit graphics engine miscalculates initial viewport width constraints when a layout track is physically flipped, the screen view defaults and snaps to the far left edge instead of resting on the right. This leaves trailing text layers hidden until the scrollbar is dragged.

## 🛠️ The Solution
The canvas scroll boundaries are optimized. By maintaining a standard `flex-direction: row;` configuration but setting a logical direction matrix override (`direction: rtl;`) onto the wrapper, you instruct the browser's engine to treat the right rim boundary as the starting point. Child nodes are immediately reset via `direction: ltr;` to preserve standard language text-alignment profiles. This locks scroll view coordinates perfectly to the right margin across all devices.
